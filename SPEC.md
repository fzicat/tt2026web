i currently have a cli app with 3 modules: IBKR, FBN, Equity

i want to keep the CLI. Do not do any change to it

i want to build a new web app using nextjs and react
the web app will have the same functionalities as the cli app
a login page (supabase user)

- i want the web app to have a hacker/minimalist style
- use the gruvbox dark theme.
- accent color is orange (gruvbox)
- mobile friendly

the web app will run on vercel
.env content will be imported on vercel environment variables
